# Project 2: Roll The Dice
This is the second project in the journey. The goal of this project is to learn about DOM and its features such as dynamically selecting, adding & updating UI elements.

#### In this project following things are used
* ```<figure>``` over ```<div>``` to organise HTML structure
* ```getElementById``` and ```querySelector``` to select and manipulate DOM elements
* Custom fonts from google font API

### Challenges Faced
More of an artistic challenge of selecting right color and fonts.

### Solutions To Challenges
Use professional resources
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for custom fonts
* [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co) for color palette selection

### Key Takeaway
Designing isnt my gig (Hopefully above choices make this project decent)
