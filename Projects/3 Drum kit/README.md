# Project 3: Drum Kit
The goal of this project is to explore more about event listeners (adding & handling multiple event listeners on single element), audion integration

#### In this project following things are used
* ```<figure>``` over ```<div>``` to organise HTML structure
* ```getElementById``` and ```querySelector``` to select and manipulate DOM elements

### Challenges Faced
Playing audio

### Solutions To Challenges
Security updates on browsers makes old code (general code on stackoverflow) useless

### Key Takeaway
* To target alphabet keys use ```keypress``` rather than ```keydown``` 
* Browser security & updates play a role in the development, when things just dont work and error messages dont make any sense, read broswer update logs
* Breakdown the actions and interaction flow before start writing the code
